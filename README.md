# ⚠️ This project has moved.

After the official release of Vue 3, this project was re-written in the Composition API that the Vue docs now recommend for larger apps. With the scale of the changes making the project's history prior to the rewrite largely irrelevant, I chose to just start a new repo instead of keeping the ~100 now useless commits in the git log.

You may find the new repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/sleepycrow/quatro-fe) or [sr.ht](https://sr.ht/~sleepycrow/quatro-fe)

## Quatro-FE

A (work-in-progress!!) single-column Pleroma frontend built with Vue 3. It aims to be beautiful, user-friendly and easy to modify.

**It's still very heavily under development. Nothing is final, everything is broken :p**
